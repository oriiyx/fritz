# F3D - Fritz Dynamic Data Framework

> A high-performance Go framework for building type-safe dynamic entity management systems

F3D combines the flexibility of dynamic schema definitions with Go's compile-time type safety, enabling developers to
build robust data management applications with custom entity structures defined at runtime.

## What is F3D?

F3D is a kernel-based application framework that reimagines how structured data systems are built. It allows you to:

- **Define entity schemas dynamically** through JSON-based class definitions
- **Generate type-safe database operations** automatically via SQLC
- **Build extensible applications** using a plugin architecture
- **Manage complex data hierarchies** with built-in relationship support
- **Scale with confidence** leveraging Go's performance and PostgreSQL's reliability

Perfect for building Product Information Management (PIM) systems, content management platforms, or any application
requiring flexible, structured data models.
